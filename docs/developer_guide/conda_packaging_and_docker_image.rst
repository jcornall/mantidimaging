Conda Packaging and Docker images
=================================

The preferred method of packaging the package is as a Conda package.

This is most likely to be the simplest way to distribute the package;
Anaconda Cloud is the simplest way to obtain dependencies (for instance,
TomoPy).

All packaging is handled in the Github Actions. Please look at the 
Action scripts for the up-to-date reference of the actual steps.
